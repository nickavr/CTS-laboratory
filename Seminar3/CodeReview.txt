Code review

1. Code structure and naming conventions:
-package name is too generic; no module name ?
-class name is the opposite of clean code (not proper)
-the function name is too generic
-function arguments names are not ok
-t and s must have meaningful names

2. Implementation:
-too many 'magic numbers' (hardcoded values)
-is t limited to {1, 2, 3, 4} or it can > 4 ?
-there are no validations for t, s, perioada

3.Single responsability & KISS
-outsource the intermediary operations into new simple functions

4. Reduce the complexity of the existing functions - KISS & Single responsability
-reduce the complexity from the getPriceWithDiscount - repeating pattern
-remove the switch by refactoring the first case to match the others

5. Single Responsaibility & Dependency inversion(DiP)
-refactor custom exceptions framework
- remove the dependency on how we validate the price and the account age
- remove the dependency on values and operations that are managed by marketing department
